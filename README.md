# Reading List

This repository is used to maintain my personal reading list hosted via GitHub Pages.

The design and code of this reading list was originally created by [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos). Thanks to him for making such a nice page for a reading list.

As such most portions of the code are under a [MIT license](https://github.com/bamos/reading-list/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE.mit)
